Project Description: FastAPI Admin Dashboard
This project is an Admin Dashboard built using FastAPI and Bootstrap to manage users and transactions. It includes a fully functional backend with API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as a user-friendly interface for administrators.

Key Features:
User Management: Admins can view, create, edit, and delete users through the dashboard.
Transaction Management: Admins can view all transactions, edit transaction details, and delete transactions.
Pop-up Modals for Editing: Editing users and transactions is done through modal pop-ups, allowing seamless updates without page reloads.
Statistics Display: The dashboard shows real-time statistics, including the total number of transactions and the total amount of all transactions.
Responsive Design: The interface is built with Bootstrap, ensuring it looks good on all devices.
Tech Stack:
FastAPI: As the web framework, providing fast, asynchronous API operations.
SQLAlchemy: For database interactions and ORM.
Bootstrap: For responsive, mobile-first UI design.
Jinja2: As the templating engine for rendering HTML with data from the backend.
JavaScript: For handling frontend interactions like editing and deleting entries via fetch API.
This project is ideal for managing databases with users and transactions in small to medium-sized applications where administrators need to easily control and monitor data.
